# Expected Results

Stable assertions for deterministic verification with the bundled mock scenarios.
Ignore `sessionId`, timestamps, and artifact paths.
Use the available `riela` command. Add `--scope user` for a user-scope
install, or `--workflow-definition-dir <root>` when validating an unpacked
workflow directory.

## Validate

Command:

```bash
riela workflow validate codex-design-and-implement-review-loop
```

Expected result: the workflow is valid.

## Run

Issue-resolution command:

```bash
riela workflow run codex-design-and-implement-review-loop \
  --mock-scenario .riela/workflows/codex-design-and-implement-review-loop/mock-scenario.json \
  --output json
```

Expected stable run summary:

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "workflowName": "codex-design-and-implement-review-loop",
  "workflowId": "codex-design-and-implement-review-loop",
  "nodeExecutions": 29,
  "transitions": 28,
  "exitCode": 0
}
```

Expected final output node: `workflow-output`

## Run (feature fanout)

Feature-fanout command, exercising the bounded fanout path where the intake
step emits `when.has_feature_fanout` with a non-empty `payload.featureFanoutItems`
array. Each item runs the feature-local design/plan branch concurrently before
joining at `step5-feature-plan-join`:

```bash
riela workflow run codex-design-and-implement-review-loop \
  --mock-scenario .riela/workflows/codex-design-and-implement-review-loop/mock-scenario-fanout.json \
  --output json
```

Expected stable run summary:

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "workflowName": "codex-design-and-implement-review-loop",
  "workflowId": "codex-design-and-implement-review-loop",
  "nodeExecutions": 18,
  "transitions": 17,
  "exitCode": 0
}
```

The run routes `step1-issue-intake` → `[fanout: feature-local-plan]` →
`step5-feature-plan-join` → `step6-implement` → … → `workflow-output`, skipping
the linear single-feature design/plan steps. The join receives the ordered
branch outputs through `runtimeVariables.fanoutJoin`.

Expected final output node: `workflow-output`, with `payload.status` `accepted`.
