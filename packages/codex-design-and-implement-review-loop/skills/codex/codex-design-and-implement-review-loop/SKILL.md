name: codex-design-and-implement-review-loop
description: Run the all-Codex Riela workflow for analysis, design, implementation planning, implementation, independent review, verification, documentation, and completion checks. Use for issue resolution or planning-only handoff when Codex should own every agent role; do not use when Claude or Fable should participate.

# Codex Design And Implement Review Loop

Run the installed `codex-design-and-implement-review-loop` workflow instead of
manually emulating its orchestration.

## Responsibility split

- Codex `gpt-6-astra`: design, implementation-plan authoring, final combined design/implementation consistency review
- Codex `gpt-5.6-sol`: implementation, revisions, design/plan review and all other coordination
- Codex `gpt-5.6-terra`: implementation, integrity and adversarial reviews

Design and planning each use one author node. Commit accepted plans before native same-branch implementation/review fanout. The join aggregates runtime-owned change evidence; serial repair and independent combined review are mandatory before final commit, push and base integration. No worktrees. Failed branches remain pending; accepted IDs feed native dependency scheduling. Requires the matching Riela fanout.dependencies/changeTracking support.

## Run

```bash
riela workflow validate codex-design-and-implement-review-loop
riela workflow inspect codex-design-and-implement-review-loop --output json
riela workflow run codex-design-and-implement-review-loop \
  --variables '{"workflowInput":{"requestedOutcome":"Implement and verify the requested change.","targetScope":"Describe the target scope.","constraints":["Do not modify unrelated files."],"acceptanceCriteria":["The requested behavior works."],"verificationHint":"Run the smallest relevant verification."}}' \
  --output jsonl
```

Use `--scope user` for a user-scope install. Preserve the operator's requested
mode, constraints, authorization boundaries, and acceptance criteria. The
workflow may prepare a commit and push near completion, so do not run it unless
those repository mutations are authorized; otherwise use inspection or
validation without starting the workflow.

Report the resulting artifacts, changed files, verification evidence, review
decisions, residual risks, and final workflow status.

## Maintainer verification

After changing this packaged workflow or skill in the registry checkout, run:

```bash
riela workflow validate codex-design-and-implement-review-loop \
  --workflow-definition-dir ./packages/codex-design-and-implement-review-loop/workflows
bun .agents/skills/riela-package-release/scripts/update-package-digests.ts \
  codex-design-and-implement-review-loop
```
